# Getting Started

Ageniti helps an existing React or TypeScript app expose selected product actions to agent hosts and automation tools.

It does not create an agent. It makes your app callable by agent hosts.

## Install

```text
npm install @ageniti/core
```

Ageniti is ESM-only and requires Node.js 20 or newer.

## 1. Pick One App Capability

Start with one capability already present in your app:

- create a task
- search workspace records
- summarize a document
- export a report
- deploy a project

Do not start by rewriting your app. Extract or wrap the capability you want to expose.

## 2. Define An Action

```js
import { defineAction, s } from "@ageniti/core";

export const hello = defineAction({
  name: "hello",
  description: "Say hello to a person.",
  input: s.object({
    name: s.string().min(1).describe("Name to greet"),
  }),
  output: s.object({
    message: s.string(),
  }),
  run({ name }) {
    return { message: `Hello, ${name}.` };
  },
});
```

## 3. Create An App

```js
import { createAgenitiApp } from "@ageniti/core";
import { hello } from "./actions/hello.js";

export const app = createAgenitiApp({
  name: "hello-tool",
  description: "A simple greeting capability packaged for agent hosts.",
  attribution: {
    text: "Powered by Ageniti",
    vendor: "Ageniti",
    product: "Ageniti Core",
    url: "https://ageniti.dev",
    docsUrl: "https://ageniti.dev/docs",
  },
  docs: {
    summary: "Use this app when an agent needs to greet a person.",
  },
  actions: [hello],
});
```

## 4. Expose CLI

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { app } from "./app.js";

await app.createCli().main();
```

The optional `attribution` block is useful when you want generated CLI, MCP, tool metadata, and bundle artifacts to include a visible credit or product origin.

Now run:

```text
hello-tool hello --name Aiden
hello-tool hello --json '{"name":"Aiden"}'
hello-tool hello --schema
hello-tool manifest
hello-tool build
hello-tool build docs
hello-tool docs
hello-tool package
hello-tool publish
hello-tool mcp
hello-tool dev --port 4321
```

## 5. Expose AI Tools

```js
const openaiTools = app.createOpenAITools();
const responsesTools = app.createOpenAIResponsesTools();
const aiSdkTools = app.createAISDKTools();
```

## 6. Use From React

```js
const { useAction } = app.createReactAdapter();
const runHello = useAction(hello);

await runHello({ name: "Aiden" });
```

This adapter can be used from your existing event handlers. It does not require replacing your React app structure.

## 7. Build Or Package Official Artifacts

When you are ready to ship CLI or MCP launchers:

```js
await app.build({
  targets: ["bundle"],
  appModule: "./src/ageniti/app.js",
  appExport: "app",
  outDir: "./dist/ageniti",
});
```

Or from the CLI:

```text
hello-tool build
hello-tool docs
hello-tool package
hello-tool publish
```

`docs` prints or exports a single `GUIDE.md` generated from your app-level and action-level natural-language descriptions.
`package` builds the bundle and runs `npm pack` in the output directory so you get a distributable `.tgz`.
`publish` performs an npm publish dry-run by default. Use live publish only when you are ready to release for real.

The generated bundle includes its own `README.md` with deployment instructions. In practice, users ship one of these shapes:

- CLI: publish the generated npm package, then users run the package bin.
- MCP: point the MCP client at `node ./mcp-stdio.mjs` locally, or at the published `<bin-name>-mcp` command after npm install.
- HTTP: deploy your own backend and mount `app.createHttpHandler()` so your existing auth, sessions, and infrastructure stay in charge.
